*CS 5353 Final Project By Aaron Schindler and Herbert Wright*

A GAN that performs style swapping given defined style classes. 
The primary purpose of this GAN is to perform face swapping.

# Project Overview

This repo contains the code for our final project in deep learning.
The folder structure is as follows:

- `src` folder: a package that contains the code for BertonGan and its usage.
- `experiments` folder: contains utilities and code for various experiments with BertonGan
- `docs` folder contains documents and resources for our paper

There are `.ipynb` notebooks in the parent directory, these can be run in google colab and showcase
training and experimenting with BertonGan.


# Requirements

This code works with:
- python (3.10.4)
- pytorch (1.13.0)
  - for cpu

# Usage

## Training

The file `src/trainings` contains code to help with training

## Inference

There are many ways to use BertonGan.


## Testing

The following files will run tests if run as `'__main__'`:
